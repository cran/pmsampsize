Description: Computes the minimum sample size required for the development of a new multivariable prediction model using the criteria proposed by Riley et al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992>. pmsampsize can be used to calculate the minimum sample size for the development of models with continuous, binary or survival (time-to-event) outcomes. Riley et al. (2018) <doi: 10.1002/sim.7992> lay out a series of criteria the sample size should meet. These aim to minimise the overfitting and to ensure precise estimation of key parameters in the prediction model.
